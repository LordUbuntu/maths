#   A collection of various math-specific functions and programs
#   written for discrete mathematics to better understand concepts.
#   Everything herein was written for fun and practice.
#   I stand on the shoulders of giants, so I claim none of it as my own.
#
#   Thank you to Professor Richard J. Sutcliffe for being such an awesome
#   teacher and inspiration for both my discrete math courses.
#   I had a lot of fun taking that course (though it was hard) and hope to
#   carry this knowledge into my future, and continue to learn and improve
#   because of it. Hopefully I will grow and transform.
