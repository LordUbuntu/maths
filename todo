New scheme: math files are named after mathematicians and have to do with their theorems and stuff, this is because a file heirarchy based on subject doesn't work since the various disciplines (discrete, analysis, toplogy, etc) don't neatly section off into different parts, it's not always clear what belongs where. So instead we have 1 flat repo with various maths. A better way or organizing may still come, but this seems the best for now I guess...
